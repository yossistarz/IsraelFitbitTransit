Tasks that needs to be done:
1. Need to brake down the messages from the companion (just a bit too large)
2. Need Rebuild data in the watch (taking into acount the base time since the data is sent in minutes relative to the message now time).
3. Add UI
  3.1 Add refresh logo
  3.2 Add refresh button
  3.3 Add a list of items that will be refreshed from the cache
  3.4 Change the data to be saved in a cache

4. Companion needs to refresh data according to the location change
5. Companion needs to keep refreshing only when it is relevant (like after a lot of time when the watch app was not in use, stop
   refreshing until next big location change -> Maybe disable this until next app load)
